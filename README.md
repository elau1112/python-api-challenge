# python-api-challenge
#Two .csv files have been generated via the WeatherPy_EL.ipynb. 
#One was generated on 2/7/2021 with a data size of n=570 and saved as weather_570_.csv. 
#The other one was generated on 2/8/2021 with a data size of n=574 and saved as weather_574_.csv.
#Both files were used as the Resource files in VacationPy.ipynb with two sets of results, observed trends, required plots, and heat maps generated.
#The VacationPy_574_MAIN_EL.ipynb analysis included the images in the Images_574 folder. This is the main file for your kind review.
#The VacationPy_570_additional analysis_EL.ipynb analysis included the images in the Images_570 folder. This is additional file for reference only.
 

#Key observations have been included in the Jupyter notebooks (WeatherPy and VacationPy) as requested.
#I have confirmed in class that the completed api_keys.py file would not be required to be uploaded to github in this submission. Thus, I have removed this file prior to git push.
#Many thanks. Have a great day.
#~Elizabeth Lau
